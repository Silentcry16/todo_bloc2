# todo_bloc2

Dear Friends,

I want to share an exciting project with youâ€”a complete Flutter app that serves as a notepad with some cool features. This app utilizes the bloc state management pattern, ensuring smooth functionality.

In this app, you can create, remove, delete, edit, and mark your notes as done or undone. It's designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making note-taking a breeze.

We've also implemented a sleek dark theme, enhancing the app's visual appeal.

I invite you to check out this app and experience its simplicity and convenience firsthand. It's a perfect tool for organizing your thoughts and staying productive.


hope you learn something new from this repository, if you found any bug please share it on 'Issues'.
